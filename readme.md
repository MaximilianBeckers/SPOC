*SPOC - Statistical Processing of cryo-EM maps*

SPOC, short for Statistical Processing of cryo-EM maps, is a software package
which contains statistical tools for the analysis and processing of cryo-EM maps.
Included are tools for Condence Map generation, local map processing as well
as resolution estimation (global and local) by permutation testing and false discovery rate control.
